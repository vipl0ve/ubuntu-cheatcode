# ubuntu-cheatcode

As a new Ubuntu user, I needed all the cheatcodes I need to make my life easier. I spent hours searching for these cheats at various forums such as AskUbunutu, Stack-overflow or other blogs on internet, and I start collecting them.

This repo is the my collections which can be useful for other ubuntu newbies. Most of these are popular must have cheatcodes. Feel free to add others if you find them interesting or useful.
